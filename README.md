# AudioLightenessVisualizer
WPF/C# based project with using of FFT to change output lighteness based on playing audio

Used 3rd-party packages (and many thanks to):
1) CSCore (https://github.com/filoe/cscore) -- for FFT audio processing and audio loopback capture;
2) MahApps Metro (https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro) -- for UI stuff, but was required for beautiful charts.

Yellow-bordered elements will show help tooltips while hovering.

Good luck!
